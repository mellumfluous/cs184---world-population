# Data used

The datasets used in our project were very large and github does not support them. Links to them can be found here. 

For some data sets, we had to restructure the data and we broke it up into smaller chunks. Those are here as well.


## Original datasets sets and links
- [Population data and predictions](https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/CSV/)
- - `All variants` one
- - File name `WPP2017_TotalPopulationBySex.csv`


## Created datasets


Note: We only restructured but never added to nor modified the data
